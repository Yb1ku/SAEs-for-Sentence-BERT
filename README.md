# Master's Thesis – A method for interpreting features in Sparse Autoencoders 

This repository contains the code and resources used for the development of a method for interpreting mono-semantic features 
in Sparse Autoencoders. The SAE will take an embedding created by Sentence-BERT and obtain mono-semantic features from a specific
context (Machine Learning and Astrophysics). The novelty of this work is the use of a brand new feature interpretation method 
based on keyword extraction via KeyBERT. 

## 📌 Objectives 
- Train a JumpReLU Sparse Autoencoder on embeddings obtained from different specific datasets. 
- Analyze the features obtained from the SAE and interpret them using a new method based on KeyBERT.
